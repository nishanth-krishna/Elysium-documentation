# Using coordinate and region maps

OpenSearch has a standard set of GeoJSON files that provide a vector map with each region map. OpenSearch Dashboards also provides basic map tiles with a standard vector map to create region maps. You can configure the base map tiles using  [Web Map Service (WMS)](https://www.ogc.org/standards/wms). For more information, see  [Configuring WMS in OpenSearch Dashboards](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/maptiles/).

For air gapped environments, OpenSearch Dashboards provides a self-host maps server. For more information, see  [Using the self-host maps server](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/selfhost-maps-server/)

While you canâ€™t configure a server to support user-defined vector map layers, you can configure your own GeoJSON file and upload it for this purpose.

## Customizing vector maps with GeoJSON[](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/visualize/geojson-regionmaps/#customizing-vector-maps-with-geojson)

If you have a specific locale that is not provided by OpenSearch Dashboards vector maps, such as a US county or US ZIP Code, you can create your own custom vector map with a GeoJSON file. To create a custom region map you would define a geographic shape such as a polygon with multiple coordinates. To learn more about the various geographic shapes that support a custom region map location, see  [Geoshape field type](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/opensearch/supported-field-types/geo-shape/).

GeoJSON format allows you to encode geographic data structures. To learn more about the GeoJSON specification, go to  [geojson.org](https://geojson.org/).

You can use  [geojson.io](https://geojson.io/#map=2/20.0/0.0)  to extract GeoJSON files.

> **PREREQUISITE**  To use a custom vector map with GeoJSON, install these two required plugins:
> 
> -   OpenSearch Dashboards Maps  [`dashboards-maps`](https://github.com/opensearch-project/dashboards-maps)  front-end plugin
> -   OpenSearch  [`geospatial`](https://github.com/opensearch-project/geospatial)  backend plugin

### Step 1: Creating a region map visualization[](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/visualize/geojson-regionmaps/#step-1-creating-a-region-map-visualization)

To create your own custom vector map, upload a JSON file that contains GEO data for your customized regional maps. The JSON file contains vector layers for visualization.

1.  Prepare a JSON file to upload. Make sure the file has either a .geojson or .json extension.
2.  On the top menu bar, go to  **OpenSearch Dashboards > Visualize**.
3.  Select the  **Create Visualization**  button.
4.  Select  **Region Map**.
5.  Choose a source. For example,  **[Flights] Flight Log**.
6.  In the right panel, select  **Import Vector Map**.
7.  In  **Upload map**, select or drag and drop your JSON file and then enter  **Map name prefix**  (for example,  `usa-counties`). Your map will have the prefix that you defined followed by the  `-map`  suffix (for example,  `usa-counties-map`), as shown in the following image:

8.  Select the  **Import file**  button and then select the  **Refresh**  button in the pop-up window confirming successful upload, as shown in the following image.

### Step 2: Viewing the custom region map in OpenSearch Dashboards[](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/visualize/geojson-regionmaps/#step-2-viewing-the-custom-region-map-in-opensearch-dashboards)

After you upload a custom GeoJSON file, you need to set the vector map layer to custom, and select your vector map:

1.  From  **Layer Options > Layer settings**, select  **Custom vector map**.
2.  Under  **Vector map**, select the name of the vector map that you just uploaded.
3.  Optional: Under  **Style settings**, increase  **Border thickness**  to see the borders more clearly.
4.  Select the  **Update**  button.
5.  View your region map in the Dashboards. For example, the following image shows the Los Angeles and San Diego county regions:

#### EXAMPLE GEOJSON FILE[](https://opensearch.org/docs/latest/dashboards/visualize/geojson-regionmaps/#example-geojson-file)

The following example GeoJSON file provides coordinates for two US counties.
