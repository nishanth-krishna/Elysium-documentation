# Setting the time filter

You can change the time range to display dashboard data over minutes, hours, days, weeks, months, or years.

The default time range is  **Last 15 minutes**. You can change the time range at the dashboard level or under  **Stack Management > Advanced Settings > Time filter defaults**.

To change the time range at the dashboard level, perform the following steps:

1.  From an OpenSearch Dashboards application (Discover, Dashboard, or Visualize), select the time clock or calendar icon.
2.  Select one of the time filter options, as shown in the following image:
    
    -   **Quick select:**  Choose a time based on the last or next number of seconds, minutes, hours, days, or another time unit.
    -   **Commonly used:**  Choose a common time range like  **Today**,  **Last 7 days**, or  **Last 30 days**.
    -   **Recently used date ranges:**  Select a previously used time range.
    -   **Refresh every:**  Set an automatic refresh period.
